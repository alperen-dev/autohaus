# autohaus
## This is a WebApp written in ASP.NET EF6 and with the help of SQL Server. "autohaus" is the german word for car dealership.

Originally, this was/is a school project for the Modularbeit M133. Pushes and Commits can be seen in the GitHub Classroom repo of this project, but which also is private (for now). Here you can just study around with my code or even improve it as long as you follow the rules in the License.

Please read the License before doing anything with the code.

Thank you!
